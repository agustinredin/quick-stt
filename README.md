This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Streaming audio transcription

To stream microphone audio to OpenAI's transcription API every few seconds run:

```bash
npm run openai-stream
```

The script records two-second audio chunks using ffmpeg and prints the resulting transcription to the console. Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` in your environment before running.

In the web app, if your browser lacks built‑in speech recognition the record button will capture 2‑second microphone chunks and send them to OpenAI for transcription using the same API key.
